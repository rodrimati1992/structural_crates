[features]
# A private internal feature,this is required to run tests in this crate,
# because declaring a crate as both a `[dependency]` and a `[dev-dependency]` causes 
# their features to be combined,
# causing the optional crates of `as_derive_utils` that are only for testing
# to be enabled in regular builds.
