This library provides field accessor traits,and emulation of structural types.

# Features

These are the features this library provides:

- [Derivation of the 3 accessor traits for every public field
](https://docs.rs/structural/0.3/structural/docs/structural_macro/index.html)
(GetFieldImpl/GetFieldMutImpl/IntoFieldImpl),
and aliases for the optional and non-optional variants of those traits.

- [Declaration of trait aliases for accessor trait bounds,using field-in-trait syntax.
](https://docs.rs/structural/0.3/structural/macro.structural_alias.html).

- [The `impl_struct` macro to declare structural parameter/return types
](https://docs.rs/structural/0.3/structural/macro.impl_struct.html),
as well as
[`make_struct` to construct anonymous structs ](https://docs.rs/structural/0.3/structural/macro.make_struct.html)

- [The GetFieldExt extension trait,which defines the main methods to access fields,
so long as the type implements the accessor traits to access those fields.
](https://docs.rs/structural/0.3/structural/trait.GetFieldExt.html)

# Clarifications

The way that this library emulates structural types is by using traits as bounds 
or trait objects.

By default all structural types are open,
structs and enums can have more variants and or fields than are required.

The only exception to this is exhaustive enums,
in which the variant count and names must match exactly,
this is useful for exhaustive pattern matching 
(in the [switch macro](https://docs.rs/structural/0.3/structural/macro.switch.html)).

# Future plans

None right now.

# no-std support

To use `structural` in no_std contexts disable the default-feature.

```toml
structural={version="<insert_version_number_here>",default_features=false}
```

This crate has few items that require the standard library (instead of core/alloc),
it is required by default so that users that are not aware of the core/alloc libraries don't have 
to pass a feature to enable std support.

# Cargo Features

These are the cargo features in structural:

- `std`: Enables std support,this is enabled by default.

- `alloc`:
    Enables alloc crate support,this is enabled by default.

- `specialization`:
    Enables specialization inside structural,without enabling the nightly feature flag.
    This is for the case that specialization is stabilized after the last update to this library.

- `nightly_specialization`:
    Enables specialization inside structural,
    requires nightly because it enables the nightly feature.

- `impl_fields`:
    This allows using `field_name:impl Foo` fields in the `structural_alias` macro,
    which as of 2019-11-23 requires the `associated_type_bounds` Rust nightly feature.<br>
    If this doesn't work,try using the "nightly_impl_fields" feature in Rust nightly instead.

- `nightly_impl_fields`
    Equivalent to the `impl_fields` feature,
    as well as enabling the `associated_type_bounds` nightly features required
    for using the feature as of 2019-11-23.

- `use_const_str`:
    Changes the internal implementation of `TStr` (the type level string type)
    to use a `&'static str` const parameter instead of types.<br>
    Use this if const generics (eg:`struct S<const S: &'static str>;`) are usable on stable.

- `nightly_use_const_str`:
    Equivalent to the `impl_fields` feature,
    which also enables the nightly Rust features required for const generics as of 2020-03-01.



Specialization is used inside `structural` for performance reasons.
There are no benchmarks comparing when specialization is enabled and disabled yet.

# Minimum Rust version

This crate support Rust back to 1.40,
and uses a build script to automatically enable features from newer versions.
