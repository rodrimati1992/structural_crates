This library provides field accessor traits,and emulation of structural types.

# Features

These are some of the features this library provides:

- [`Structural`] derive macro to implement accessor traits for every public field:
[`GetField`]/[`GetFieldMut`]/[`IntoField`] for structs,
and [`GetVariantField`]/[`GetVariantFieldMut`]/[`IntoVariantField`] for enums.

- The [`StructuralExt`] extension trait,which defines the main methods to access fields,
so long as the type implements the accessor traits for those fields.

- The [`StrucWrapper`] wrapper type,defined as an alternative to [`StructuralExt`].

- The [`structural_alias`] macro, to declare trait aliases for accessor traits,
using field-in-trait syntax.

- The [`impl_struct`] macro to declare structural parameter/return types,
as well as [`make_struct`] to construct anonymous structs

- The [`FromStructural`] and [`TryFromStructural`] conversion traits,
similar (but not identical) to the standard library `From` and `TryFrom` traits
for structural types.

# Examples

For **examples** you can look at
[the examples section of the documentation for the root module of the structural crate
](https://docs.rs/structural/0.4/structural/index.html#root-mod-examples)

# Clarifications

The way that this library emulates structural types is by using traits as bounds
or trait objects.

All the `structural` traits are dyn-compatible(also known as object-safe),
and no change will be made to make them not dyn-compatible.

By default all structural types are open,
structs and enums can have more variants and or fields than are required.<br>
The only exception to this is exhaustive enums,
in which the variant count and names must match exactly,
this is useful for exhaustive matching of variants (in the [`switch`] macro).

Every trait with the `_SI`/`_ESI`/`_VSI` suffixes in the examples are traits
generated by the `Structural` derive macro.
These traits alias the accessor traits implemented by the type they're named after.

### Required macros

The only macros that are required to use this crate are the ones for [`TStr`],
every other macro expands to code that can be written manually
(except for the [`__TS`] type, that is an implementation detail that only macros from
this crate should use by name).

# Changelog

The changelog is in the "Changelog.md" file.

# Future plans

None for now

# no-std support

To use `structural` in no_std contexts disable the default-feature.

```toml
structural={version="0.4",default_features=false}
```

This crate has few items that require the `std` crate (instead of core).

The "std" and "alloc" features are enabled by default so that users that are not
aware of the `core`/`alloc` crates don't have to pass a feature to enable `std` support.

# Cargo Features

These are the cargo features in structural:

- `std`: Enables std support,this is enabled by default.

- `alloc`:
    Enables alloc crate support,this is enabled by default.

- `specialization`:
    Enables specialization inside structural,without enabling the nightly feature flag.
    This is for the case that specialization is stabilized after the last update to this library.

- `nightly_specialization`:
    Enables specialization inside structural,
    requires nightly because it enables the nightly feature.

- `impl_fields`:
    This allows using `field_name: impl Foo` fields in the [`structural_alias`] macro,
    which as of 2020-03-21 requires the `associated_type_bounds` Rust nightly feature.<br>
    If this doesn't work,try using the "nightly_impl_fields" feature in Rust nightly instead.

- `nightly_impl_fields`
    Equivalent to the `impl_fields` feature,
    as well as enabling the `associated_type_bounds` nightly features required
    for using the feature as of 2020-03-21.

- `use_const_str`:
    Changes the internal implementation of `TStr` (the type level string type)
    to use a `&'static str` const parameter instead of types.<br>
    Use this if const generics (eg:`struct Foo<const S: &'static str>;`) are usable on stable.

- `nightly_use_const_str`:
    Equivalent to the `use_const_str` feature,
    which also enables the nightly Rust features required for const generics as of 2020-03-21.

- `disable_const_str`:
    Disables const generics,
    useful if other crates enabling const generics causes internal errors in this Rust version.

Specialization is used inside `structural` for performance reasons.
There are no benchmarks comparing when specialization is enabled and disabled yet.

# Minimum Rust version

This crate support Rust back to 1.40,
and uses a build script to automatically enable features from newer versions.

It requires Rust 1.40 to use proc macros in type position,eg: [`TS`] and [`FP`].
