/// - The `<TStr_<_> as MarkerType>::MTVAL` associated constant.

/// Examples of constructing a `TStr_<_>`:
///
/// - `tstr!(foo)` (in every Rust version)

/// - `tstr!("bar")` (in every Rust version)
///
/// - `tstr!(1)` (in every Rust version)
///
/// - `tstr!(100)` (in every Rust version)
///
/// - `tstr!(1 0 0)` (in every Rust version)
///
/// - `<TStr!("hello")>::NEW` (from Rust 1.40 onwards)

/// - `<TStr!(world)>::NEW` (from Rust 1.40 onwards)

/// - `<TStr!(100)>::NEW` (from Rust 1.40 onwards)
